Differences:
- Batches hunks related to same files to optimize rate limiting
- Makes use of Gemini 1 million tokens context window <br> by attaching whole file together with changes for better context
- Optimized diff parsing algoritm that work better with GitHub (maybe)
- Uses Structured Output mode of Gemini API for better parsing of AI output
- Rotates API keys through `GEMINI_ALT_1` >> `GEMINI_ALT_4` (dont forget to set them in repos secrets) <br> in case your PRs are really big and active
- Auto-commits AI-actionable JSON report to your repo /reviews/ folder for futher agentic processing
- Uses JSON file in question during PR update run to load previous comments from last run <br> for better context during subsequent runs
