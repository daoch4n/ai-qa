Differences:
- Talks to you as cute white robot <br> (if you set it up)
- Automatically runs on PR creation, update , reopen
- Batches hunks related to same files <br> to optimize rate limiting
- Makes use of Gemini 1 million tokens context window <br> by attaching whole file together with changes for better context
- Optimized diff parsing algoritm <br> that works better with GitHub (maybe?)
- Uses Structured Output mode of Gemini API <br> for better parsing of AI output
- Rotates API keys <br> through `GEMINI_ALT_1` >> `GEMINI_ALT_4` <br> (dont forget to set them in repo secrets) <br> in case your PRs are really big and active
- Auto-commits AI-actionable JSON report <br> as cute white robot to your repo `/reviews/` folder <br> for futher agentic processing
- Uses JSON file in question during PR update run <br> to load previous comments from last run <br> for better context during subsequent runs
