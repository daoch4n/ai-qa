Differences:
- Batches hunks related to same files to optimize rate limiting
- Makes use of Gemini 1 million tokens context window by attaching whole file together with changes for better context
- Loads previous comments on PR update for better context
- Optimized diff parsing algoritm that work better with GitHub (maybe)
- Uses Structured Output mode of Gemini API for better parsing of AI output
